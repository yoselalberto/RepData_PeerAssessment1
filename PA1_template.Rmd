data_raw <- read_csv("activity.zip")

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r viz_steps_day}
steps_day_mean <- data_raw %>% 
  count(date, wt = steps) %>%
  mutate(day = wday(date, label = TRUE, abbr = F)) %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% summarise(mean_day = mean(n, na.rm = TRUE))
# plot
ggplot(steps_day_mean, aes(day, mean_day)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "forestgreen") +
  labs(x = "Day of the week", y = "Steps", 
       title = "Mean of steps taken per day")
  
```
